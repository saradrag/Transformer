# Transformer
The following is my implementation of transformer as described in **the original paper** 
*https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762*.
The purpose was to understand every bit of the architecture described.
The problem that my code is currently solving is sorting an array.
## How to use
To run the code, run data.py once to generate the data, and then run train.py. You can adjust parameters in parameters.py. 
Note that positional encoding isn't implemented yet since it's not needed for the task.
