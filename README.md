# Transformer
The following is my implementation of transformer as described in **the original paper** 
*https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762*.
The purpose was to understand every bit of the architecture described.
The problems I've tried solving are
- Sorting an array of integers (branch sorting) - works well
- Predicting sales from Store sales Kaggle dataset - doesn't work well
